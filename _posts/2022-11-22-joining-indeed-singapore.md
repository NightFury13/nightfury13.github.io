I now help people get jobs!

Elated to share that Iâ€™m starting a new position as Data Science Manager at Indeed.com. As part of this role, I've shifted my base to Singapore and will be working with the Match-Recommendations-Platform team at Indeed. Looking forward to learning the Indeed way and generate the best possible Job-Candidate matches to help people get jobs.

What started as an infatuation when I first saw Devansh Shah and Somya Mehdiratta in those cool blue "I help people get jobs" tees over 5 years back, is now slowly turning into true love. Thank you folks, for your help throughout ðŸ’™

I'd also take a moment to thank my mentors and well-wishers at XPO - Roopali Doshi for showing me first-hand how to lead an organisation, Kunal Mehta for teaching me the value of thoroughness and credibility, Satish Doguparthy for grooming me every step of the way into product-first-thinking, Rachana Dubey Sameer Shaikh for your immense love, support and guidance as I dabbled with management for the first time. Karthik Ampani Nishant Jain Nishanth Yalam Shilpa Kankaria Spandana Achanta for lending your ears to my rants and cheering me along at every milestone! The DSE team - each one of you has left a lasting impression on me and I'll be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work with you. Onwards and upwards! ðŸš€
