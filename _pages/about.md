_Musician. Geek. Footballer. Nomad. Scientist. Shinobi._

Namaste!

I'm currently a Data Science Manager at [Indeed.com](http://www.indeed.com/) and work on solving problems in the space of Job-Candidate Matching using Recommendation Systems, ML and AI. In the past, I worked with [XPO Logistics, Inc.](http://www.xpo.com/) as a Senior Data Scientist and later as the Manager for Data Science and Engineering team of 20 people, working on a large variety of industrial scale problems using computer vision, optimization and data analysis for their Less-Than-Truckload division. I was among the founding team members of India tech offices and played a key role in identifying and implementing multiple white space opportunities, while working closely with India Leadership to establish a new technology office in Hyderabad from the ground up and scaling India tech team from 1-to-100 engineers.

As a Research Scholar at [Centre for Visual Information Technology](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) in [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/), I worked on improving Unconstrained Natural Scene and Video Text Recognition using Deep Learning. Completed my M.S. (by research) degree defense from IIIT Hyderabad with majors in Computer Vision and Machine Learning under the guidance of [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/people/faculty/cvit-faculty/jawahar).

I am also a budding musician and have performed at various stages across Hyderabad. When I'm not on my guitar or singing, you'll find me on the football field! I play for the University Football Team (soccer) and have also led the team as Captain to winning the Inter-State Championships. Travel is also a new found love, so feel free to get in touch if looking for companions to bagpack across uncharted territories.
