_Musician. Geek. Footballer. Nomad. Scientist. Shinobi._

Namaste!

I am Computer Vision Research Engineer at Abzooba Infotech India Private Limited and work on a large variety of industrial computer vision related tasks. Currently working from the Pune office in India.

As a Research Scholar at [Centre for Visual Information Technology](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) in [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad](https://iiit.ac.in/), I worked on improving Unconstrained Natural Scene and Video Text Recognition using Deep Learning. Currently awaiting my M.S. (by research) degree defense from IIIT Hyderabad with majors in Computer Vision and Machine Learning under the guidance of [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/people/faculty/cvit-faculty/jawahar).

I am also a budding musician and have performed at various stages across Hyderabad. When I'm not on my guitar or singing, you'll find me on the football field! I play for the University Football Team (soccer) and have also led the team as Captain to winning the Inter-State Championships. Travel is also a new found love, so feel free to get in touch if looking for companions to bagpack across uncharted territories.
