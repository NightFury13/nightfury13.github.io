Hello there!
I am pursuing MS by Research at International Institute of Information Techology, Hyderabad. My present work is
in the field of understanding video representations and action recognition in videos. I have worked on
string sorting algorithms using heterogeneous multicore architectures in the past.

In my leisure time, I like to explore new ideas and write about them. I'm a spiritual, straightforward and a
happy-go-crazy guy. I love coding, machine learning and all things soccer.

I try reading books whenever I can, I have found books to be great friends. Here's my [library](https://dracarys983.github.io/library). Also, I learn to focus through working out at the gym and playing football. Here's my workout [information](https://dracarys983.github.io/workout-logs).

_Aside_: I love watching Naruto and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKl1mx7UIbE) is my favorite Official Soundtrack.
